== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I would like to add Captcha Plus to the Contact Form 7. How can I do this? =

1. Make sure you enabled "Contact Form 7" on the Captcha Plus settings page.
2. Go to "Contact Form 7" form where you want to make use of Captcha.
3. For the Contact Form 7 since version 4.2 on the edit form page select the BWS CAPTCHA form-tag, and insert it into your form. For the Contact Form 7 below version 4.2 on the edit form page find a dropdown menu with the form fields, select BWS CAPTCHA and insert it into your form.

= How to add Captcha Plus plugin to the Wordpress login page (form)? =

Follow the next steps in order to add Captcha Plus to your Wordpress login page (form):
1. Open your Wordpress admin Dashboard.
2. Navigate to Captcha Plus settings page.
3. Find "Enable Captcha Plus for" for the "Login form".
4. Save changes.

= Any captcha answer results an error =

Captcha Plus will only be displayed if you are using standard registration, login, comments form pages. In case of using custom forms and pages it will be necessary to make changes in them so that captcha could be displayed and work correctly.

= Add Captcha plugin to a custom form on my Wordpress website =

Follow the instructions below in order to add Captcha plugin to your custom PHP or HTML form:
1. Install the Captcha plugin and activate it.
2. (Optional) If you would like to use your own settings for the custom forms you have (for example, for your contact and sign up forms), please follow the steps below:
   - Go to your theme folder for example 'your-wp-site/wp-content/themes/your-theme-name' where your-theme-name is theme name you currently using ;
   - Open functions.php file;
   - Add the following code to the end of the file:

`function add_my_forms( $forms ) {
    $forms['my_contact_form'] = "Form Display Name";
    return $forms;
}
add_filter( 'cptch_add_form', 'add_my_forms' );`

Please don't use the next form slugs since they are predefined by plugin settings: general, wp_login, wp_register, wp_lost_password, wp_comments, bws_contact, bws_subscriber, buddypress_register, buddypress_comments, buddypress_group, cf7_contact, woocommerce_login, woocommerce_register, woocommerce_lost_password, woocommerce_checkout.
- Save file changes;
- Go to the "Settings" tab on the plugin settings page (Admin Dashboard -> Captcha); If everything is OK, you will see your form in 'Enable Captcha for' => 'External plugins' ( with labels which you specified in the "cptch_add_form_tab" hook call function ).
- Enable it and configure form options as you need;
- Click "Save changes";

If you don`t want to use your own settings for CAPTCHA displaying in your custom form, it will use the settings from "General" block on the plugin settings.

3. Open the file with the form (where you would like to add CAPTCHA);
4. Find a place to insert the code for the CAPTCHA output;
5. If you completed the instructions in point 2, then you should add:

`<?php echo apply_filters( 'cptch_display', '', 'my_contact_form' ); ?>`

In this example, the second parameter is a slug for your custom form.

Otherwise, insert the following lines:

`<?php echo apply_filters( 'cptch_display', '' ); ?>`

6. After that, you should add the following lines to the function of the entered data checking.
If you completed the instructions in point 2, then you should add:

`<?php $error = apply_filters( 'cptch_verify', true, 'string', 'my_contact_form' );
if ( true === $error ) { /* the CAPTCHA answer is right */
    /* do necessary action */
} else { /* the CAPTCHA answer is wrong or there are some other errors */
    echo $error; /* display the error message or do other necessary actions in case when the CAPTCHA test was failed */
} ?>`

In this example, the third parameter is a slug for your custom form.

Otherwise, insert the following lines:

`<?php $error = apply_filters( 'cptch_verify', true );
if ( true === $error ) { /* the CAPTCHA answer is right */
    /* do necessary action */
} else { /* the CAPTCHA answer is wrong or there are some other errors */
    echo $error; /* display the error message or do other necessary actions in case when the CAPTCHA test was failed */
} ?>`

If there is a variable in the check function responsible for the errors output, you can concatenate variable $error to this variable. If the 'cptch_verify' filter hook returns 'true', it means that you have entered the CAPTCHA answer properly. In all other cases, the function will return the string with the error message.

= Why is the CAPTCHA missing in the comments form? =

Plugin displays captcha for those comments forms which were written in the same way as comments forms for the standard WordPress themes. Unfortunately, the plugin is incompatible with comments forms generated by using SAAS (eg: Disqus or JetPack comments forms). If you don't use SAAS comments forms, please follow the next steps:
1. Using FTP, please go to {wp_root_folder}/wp-content/themes/{your_theme}.
2. Find and open "comments.php" file. It is possible that the file that is used to display the comment form in your theme called differently or comment form output functionality is inserted directly in the other templates themes (eg "single.php" or "page.php"). In this case, you need to open the corresponding file.
3. Make sure that the file contains one of the next hooks:

`do_action ( 'comment_form_logged_in_after' )
do_action ( 'comment_form_after_fields' )
do_action ( 'comment_form' )`

If you didn't find one of these hooks, then put the string `<?php do_action( 'comment_form', $post->ID ); ?>` in the comment form.

= Can I move the Captcha Plus block in the comment form? =

It depends on the comments form.
If the hook call by means of which captcha works (after_comment_field or something like this) is present in the file "comments.php", you can change captcha positioning by moving this hook call. Please find the file "comments.php" in the theme and change position of the line do_action( 'comment_form_after_fields' ); or any similar line - place it under the Submit button. In case there is no such hook in the comments file of your theme, then, unfortunately, this option is not available.

= I got the message "On your site uses functions ... that are deprecated". What should I do? =

Starting with version 4.2.3, we have changed the functionality for faster and more correct plugin work.
You need to replace the output and response checking for the CAPTCHA in your form according to [the instruction](https://support.bestwebsoft.com/hc/en-us/articles/202353439) or the appropriate point in the FAQ (see "I would like to add Captcha Plus to the custom form on my website. How can I do this?").
After making changes, simply close the message in the admin panel. If you completely updated the CAPTCHA interaction with your form the message will not be displayed anymore.

= Spam bots getting past captcha and creating new user accounts =

Unfortunately, there is no captcha that could provide 100% spam protection. Real people (and spammers) can get through captcha easily. Here is a list of simple recommendations to stop spam on your WordPress website:
- Make sure that the Captcha Plus plugin is installed, activated, updated to the latest version and integrated with your form(-s).
- Enable all captcha protection complexity. Go to the plugin settings page and enable such options as Plus, Minus, Multiplication; enable Numbers, Images, and Words.
- Try to submit the form(-s) with captcha (use the wrong answer to make sure that Captcha Plus is working correctly).
- Install and activate [Limit Attempts](https://bestwebsoft.com/products/wordpress/plugins/limit-attempts/?k=c6b924d096b75a288daf0e49a58f93c2) plugin to get additional anti-spam protection and low-down bots registration rate.

= I have some problems with the plugin's work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support? =

Please make sure that the problem hasn't been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem's description:
- The link to the page where the problem occurs
- The name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version - your order number.
- The version of your WordPress installation
- Copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wi2X8RdRGXk9kMszQy1xItJrpN0ncXgioH935MaBKtc/)
